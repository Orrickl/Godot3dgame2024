My program was made for people who love “speedrunning” games and wanted a new 3d platformer twist to it. This demographic is mostly of a younger generation. I designed it to entertain the users and help them have fun. This game is about having users improve their times and get intrinsic value from their personal best time decreasing. It's a game about self-improvement and doing your best.
